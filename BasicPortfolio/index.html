			<h2>About Josephine Pizzolato</h2>

			<img id="bio-image" src="./assets/images/Josie_2016.jpg" width="170px" height="200px" alt="Josie's Image" alt="left">

			<p class="main-bio-text">Josephine Pizzolato's diverse career path has led her from Sales &amp; Marketing to Design &amp; Art Director to Web Developer. While these stops may seem varied, she'll be the first to tell you that the diversity prepared her well for her current role as Front End Developer.</p>

			<p class="main-bio-text">Working in the technology field that is experiencing a nearly constant evolution, Josephine is dedicated to pushing herself both creatively and technically -- whether it's researching industry trends or jumping into new programming languages. It's the same fierce drive that led her to realize that in a male-dominated field sometimes a woman has to assert herself and proactively pursue opportunities. Sometimes being a woman means asking for what you want.</p>
			
			<p class="main-bio-text">It might be a challenge, but Josephine is proof that it's certainly one worth taking.</p>
